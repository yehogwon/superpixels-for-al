# Superpixels for AL in Semantic Segmentation

This repository contains an overall framework of active learning for semantic segmentation with superpixels, inspired by [Cai *et al*](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Cai_Revisiting_Superpixels_for_Active_Learning_in_Semantic_Segmentation_With_Realistic_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf). The official implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/cailile/Revisiting-Superpixels-for-Active-Learning).
